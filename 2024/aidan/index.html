                <p>The Gym AR Assistant's intended purpose is for users to scan gym equipment to get instructions and information on their benefits. However, this app is only a prototype; it will only work under certain conditions.</p>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <!-- List the instructions below -->
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Tap on the image above</li>
                    <li>Allow camera access</li>
                    <!-- Uncomment the image below to embed an image showing where to position the camera. -->
                    <!-- Don't forget to include the image in the same folder as this file. -->
                    <li>On the plate-loaded shoulder press machine, find this sticker and scan it using the app.</li>
                    <li></li><img style="margin-left: 0.4rem;" src="shoulderpress.jpeg" width = '100' height = '169'>
                    <li>Several basic pieces of information about the machine should be displayed.</li>
                    <li>Tap the instructions pop-up to switch pages for further information.</li>
                    <li>For Mr. Nolan: please check the project file too. There are other scenes that I wasn't able to access while the app was running -- take a look at what they might offer.</li>
